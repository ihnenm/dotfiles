This repo is a collection of some of my settings for vim, bash, mutt, etc.
These files are changed fairly often and sometimes stuff will break so fair warning.
Many of the settings are specific to my system to you might have to make adjustments
if you will be using them on your system, I try to provide helpful comments where
I can.
